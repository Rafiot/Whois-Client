********* Preparation *********

Take a look at the scripts in this directory: 
	init_paths.sh will initialize the path to the config file in all the files that need it
	init_assignations.py initialize the assignations by using the files provided by the whois client of debian (ip{6}_del_list)

Ensure the paths are fine.

When it is fine launch the script from the main dir of the project
