    Usage: ./whois IP
    Displays the whois entry of this IP
- get_ris:
    Usage: ./get_ris IP

Of course, you can also use this client as a library for your own applications. 
In this case, you should take a look at 
    lib/whois_client.py

You can also do bulk queries: instear of a string, you can pass to the functions a list of IPs.
