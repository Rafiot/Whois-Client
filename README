Whois client fully written in Python. It uses the list of assignations provided by the whois client of debian (https://github.com/weppos/whois-debian)

To parse the whois entries, it uses an improved version of pywhois (https://code.google.com/p/pywhois/) but the basic idea is the same. 

This code has been first written to be used in bgp ranking (http://gitorious.org/bgp-ranking) but it is now a standalone project.
