********* Preparation *********

To use the whois client, you have first to open 
    ~/install/init_paths.sh
And edit the variables "ROOT_PROJECT" and "CONFIG_PATH" accordingly to your system: 
- ROOT_PROJECT is the absolute root path to the project 
- CONFIG_PATH is the path to the configuration file of the project. It is normally ${ROOT_PROJECT}/etc/whois_client.conf.
    /!\ the path of CONFIG_PATH needs to be escaped: each '/' has to be written like this: '\/'

********* Installation*********

When it is changed, just launch init_paths.sh and then init_assignations.py.
